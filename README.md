# Kali-Linux-2025
**Credits to Linux by making Kali Linux and all the credits to them
# 🔐 Main features of Kali Linux:
1. 🔍 Penetration Testing
Kali comes with hundreds of pre-installed tools to discover and exploit vulnerabilities in networks, applications or operating systems.

Examples: Metasploit, Nmap, Wireshark, Burp Suite, Aircrack-ng.

2. 📡 Network Analysis
Allows scanning, analyzing and sniffing network traffic.

You can intercept data packets, capture passwords, or simulate MITM (Man in the Middle) attacks.

3. 💣 Exploiting and exploit development
Includes tools to launch exploits against known vulnerabilities.

Metasploit Framework is one of the most advanced exploit platforms.

4. 🔧 Reverse Engineering
Dismantle applications to analyze their behavior or discover malicious code.

Includes tools such as Ghidra, Radare2, OllyDbg, etc.

5. 🧬 Forensic Analysis
Allows the recovery of deleted data, the analysis of compromised systems and the investigation of attacks.

Can be run in "live mode" so as not to alter the analyzed data.

6. 🧠 Social Engineering and Phishing
Includes frameworks such as the Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET) for simulating social engineering attacks.

7. 📱 Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Hacking
Tools for cracking wireless network passwords (WEP/WPA/WPA2).

Ex: Aircrack-ng, Reaver, Kismet.

8. 🔐 Password Cracking and Bruteforce
Tools for cracking encrypted passwords or brute-force passwords.

Ex: John the Ripper, Hydra, Hashcat.

🖥️ Other features:
Runs on both PC and Raspberry Pi, virtual machines, or Android phones (chroot / NetHunter).

Can be run in Live Mode, without installation.

Full Disk Encryption support.

Graphical interface (GNOME, XFCE) or terminal mode only.

⚠️ Warning:
Kali Linux is a professional tool. Abusive use (illegal hacking) is illegal and punishable by law. Its purpose is to test and improve the security of permissioned systems.
